I suggest reviewing http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~psilord/blog/data/chess-pages/
for information about how chess works with bitboards.
It is not a complete archive of information (in fact the author
has not gotten very far) but the information there is very clear and concise
compared to all of the other sources that I saw.
