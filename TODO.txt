1. Read up on Bitboards (see below for suggested website)
2. Don't use namespace std except in a local context



(1) I suggest reviewing http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~psilord/blog/data/chess-pages/
for information about how chess works with bitboards.
It is not a complete archive of information (in fact the author
has not gotten very far) but the information there is very clear and concise
compared to all of the other sources that I saw.

(2) Using namespace std in the global scope of the program can be bad because it
can result in a function that was implemented in both the namespace and the using
program to clash. Seeing as we are implementing this seperately I would suggest we
do not use the namespace in a global scope. If you would like to use it in a more local
scope such as in a class, that is fine. Also DO NOT place using namespace anything in the
header files. This will result in every program using your header being forced to use the
namespace. It would likely not be a problem to use the namespace std (as opposed to others)
in a global scope, but in general it is a good thing to avoid. 

Short answer short, it is a bad idea as it is similar declaring a
variable in a global scope.
